# JavaScript Practical Exercises

This repository contains solutions to practical exercises in JavaScript, aimed at enhancing skills in function creation, DOM manipulation, data fetching, and arithmetic calculations.

## Exercises

### 1. Even or Odd Function
Write a JavaScript function that takes a number as input. If the number is even, the function should return "Even." If the number is odd, the function should return "Odd."

#### Example:
```javascript
evenOrOdd(5); // Returns: "Odd"
evenOrOdd(4); // Returns: "Even"
```

### 2. Add Item to List
Write a JavaScript function that adds a new item to a list on a webpage when a button is clicked.

Example:
```
Suppose there is an unordered list (<ul>) and a button on your webpage. When the button is clicked, the function should add a new <li> element to the list.
```
### 3. Change Background Color Based on Response
Create a function that changes the background color of an element's text based on the response it receives. If the response is "failed," change the background color to red. If the response is "successful," change the background color to green.

### 4. Fetch and Display Data
Write a function that fetches data from the JSON Placeholder API. You can choose any endpoint except the ones we used in class. After fetching the data, display the responses on a webpage.

Example:
```
If you choose the endpoint that provides a list of comments, your function should fetch the comments and display them on the webpage.
```
### 5. Solve an Arithmetic Problem Using a Formula
Write a function that accepts variables to solve an arithmetic problem using any formula of your choice. You can choose a formula like the area of a circle, the Pythagorean theorem, or any other mathematical formula.
